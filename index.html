        <h1>How To Play</h1>
        <p class="instructions-description" style="text-align: center;">Get some teammates together and create your own FantasyXC league! This game is specificially to be played on a single device and there is no cross-device linking. The website will, however, save your teams once they have been drafted so you can go back and enter the results later.</p>

                    <p class="instructions-description">Once you've created the teams, use the filters to choose who will be available for the draft. You can unselect individual runners by clicking on their name if a runner is not running for any reason. Runners are in ALL groups that apply to them so you may have to unselect them depending on the meet.</p>
